# Code Fellows Reading-Notes

## My name is Dominique and this is my reading journal for Code Fellows

To me a "growth mindset" means having a mindset that that anything is possible when you apply yourself. Think of your mind as a muscle. In order for your mind to learn new information it has to grow and it grows by working or challenging itself with new things.


* The process of learning new things can be uncomfortable but is necessary for growth.
* If you are frustrated, take a break to clear your mind and try again.
* Don't give up. Success is on the other side frustration.
